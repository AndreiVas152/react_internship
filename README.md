This is a course tracking app built as part of an internship.
There was a strict structure we had to adhere to, so there are really no libraries used and it's not what you would do for a project in production.
The main points that had to be demonstrated through the work were: understanding of react's flow, building custom components, role based access(the front-end side of it), API integration with care given to performance (as few calls as possible), Redux integration.
The next step would have been building a custom back-end using next.JS, but the internship was discontinued.
